I keep all the common files in the 'common' directory. In order to build the
Windows version, you must first create copies of these files in the 'windows'
directory using the copy-files.bat script.

Note: the Plus42 workspace contains four projects: Plus42Binary, Plus42Decimal,
keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp. Before building Plus42Binary and Plus42Decimal, you
must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp
and skins.cpp files, which contain the default keymap and the skins to be
compiled into the Plus42 executable.

The Windows build of Plus42 builds the Intel Floating-Point library from
source. Run build-intel-lib.sh 32 to build the 32-bit library; if successful,
this will create a file named cl111libbid32.lib, containing x86 objects; and/or
run build-intel-lib.sh 64 to build the 64-bit library; if successful, this will
create a file named cl111libbid64.lib, containing x86_64 objects.
